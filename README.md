# ChatClient
A chat client written in python.
I think Skype and Steam is crap, so I'm gonna try make something with features I want with 100% less stability :D
This Chat Client requires communication to a server, which is on a different repo. OkeWoke/ChatServer
## To use
used on python3, should work on python2, just change the name of some of the tkinter modules. 
i.e. tkinter.font to tkFont & tkinter to Tkinter

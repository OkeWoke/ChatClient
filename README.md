# ChatClient
A chat client written in python, with Tkinter GUI.
I think Skype and Steam is crap, so I'm gonna try make something with features I want with 100% less stability :D

This Chat Client requires communication to a dedicated server, which I am also making @ repo: OkeWoke/ChatServer

## How to use
Just exceute chatClient.py with python3.
Should work on python2, just change the name of some of the tkinter modules. 
i.e. tkinter.font to tkFont & tkinter to Tkinter, tkHyperlinkManager has a tkinter import function which must also be renamed.
